# Robolang
an esoteric programming language for robots!

Made by Oklomsy!


Robolang has three commands
Beep Boop Bap 

Beep just prints whatever you give it to the console for example.
Beep("A") will print A to the console.

Boop checks just checks if the number is larger than another number

for example. Boop(1,2) checks if 1 is larger than 2

Bap does the reverse... checking if the number is smaller.


and obviously there is a command that checks if both numbers are equal
it's Boap
